    <title>Create Flexible Layouts Using auto-fill</title>
    <!--
    The repeat function comes with an option called auto-fill. 
    This allows you to automatically insert as many rows or columns of your desired size as possible depending on the size of the container. 
    You can create flexible layouts when combining auto-fill with minmax, like this:

    repeat(auto-fill, minmax(60px, 1fr));

    When the container changes size, this setup keeps inserting 60px columns 
    and stretching them until it can insert another one. 
    Note: If your container can't fit all your items on one row, 
    it will move them down to a new one.
