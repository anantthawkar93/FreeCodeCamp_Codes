		/*One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword
		 is that you can easily overwrite variable declarations:
		A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript,
		 to solve this potential issue with the var keyword. 
		So unlike var, when you use let, 
		a variable with the same name can only be declared once.
