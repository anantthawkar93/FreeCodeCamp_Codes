			/*Replace Loops using Recursion
			Recursion is the concept that a function can be expressed in terms of itself. To help understand this, start by thinking about the following task: multiply the first n elements of an array to create the product of those elements. 
			Note: Recursive functions must have a base case when they return without calling the function again (in this example, when n <= 0), otherwise they can never finish executing.
