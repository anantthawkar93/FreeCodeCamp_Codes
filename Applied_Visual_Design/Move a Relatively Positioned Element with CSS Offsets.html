    <title>Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets</title>
    <!--
        The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. 
        Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.
    -->
    <style>
        h2 {
          position: relative;
          left: 15px;
          bottom: 10px;
        }
      </style>

    <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
  <h2>Move me!</h2>
  <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
