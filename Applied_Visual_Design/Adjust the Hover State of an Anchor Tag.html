    <title>Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag</title>
    <!--
    This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.

    For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

    a:hover {
    color: red;
    }
    -->
    <style>
        a {
          color: #000;
        }
        a:hover{
            color: blue;
        }
      
      </style>
