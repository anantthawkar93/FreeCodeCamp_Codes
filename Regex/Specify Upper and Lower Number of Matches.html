		/*Specify Upper and Lower Number of Matches
		Recall that you use the plus sign + to look for one or more characters and the asterisk * to look for zero or more characters. These are convenient but sometimes you want to match a certain range of patterns.

		You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers. Quantity specifiers are used with curly brackets ({ and }). You put two numbers between the curly brackets - for the lower and upper number of patterns.

		For example, to match only the letter a appearing between 3 and 5 times in the string ah, your regex would be /a{3,5}h/.

		let A4 = "aaaah";
		let A2 = "aah";
		let multipleA = /a{3,5}h/;
		multipleA.test(A4);
		multipleA.test(A2);
		The first test call would return true, while the second would return false.*/
