		/*Match Numbers and Letters of the Alphabet
		Using the hyphen (-) to match a range of characters is not limited to letters. It also works to match a range of numbers.

		For example, /[0-5]/ matches any number between 0 and 5, including the 0 and 5.

		Also, it is possible to combine a range of letters and numbers in a single character set.

		let jennyStr = "Jenny8675309";
		let myRegex = /[a-z0-9]/ig;
		jennyStr.match(myRegex);*/
