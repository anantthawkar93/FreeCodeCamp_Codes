									<!-- Match Everything But Letters and Numbers
		You've learned that you can use a shortcut to match alphanumerics [A-Za-z0-9_] using \w. A natural pattern you might want to search for is the opposite of alphanumerics.

		You can search for the opposite of the \w with \W. Note, the opposite pattern uses a capital letter. This shortcut is the same as [^A-Za-z0-9_].

		let shortHand = /\W/;
		let numbers = "42%";
		let sentence = "Coding!";
		numbers.match(shortHand);
		sentence.match(shortHand);
		The first match call would return the value ["%"] and the second would return ["!"]. -->
