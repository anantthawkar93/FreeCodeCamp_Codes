		/*Match All Numbers
		You've learned shortcuts for common string patterns like alphanumerics. Another common pattern is looking for just digits or numbers.

		The shortcut to look for digit characters is \d, with a lowercase d. This is equal to the character class [0-9], which looks for a single character of any number between zero and nine.*/
