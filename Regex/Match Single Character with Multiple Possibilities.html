			/*Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities
			You learned how to match literal patterns (/literal/) and wildcard character (/./). Those are the extremes of regular expressions, where one finds exact matches and the other matches everything. There are options that are a balance between the two extremes.

			You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes. Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square ([ and ]) brackets.

			For example, you want to match bag, big, and bug but not bog. You can create the regex /b[aiu]g/ to do this. The [aiu] is the character class that will only match the characters a, i, or u.

			let bigStr = "big";
			let bagStr = "bag";
			let bugStr = "bug";
			let bogStr = "bog";
			let bgRegex = /b[aiu]g/;
			bigStr.match(bgRegex);
			bagStr.match(bgRegex);
			bugStr.match(bgRegex);
			bogStr.match(bgRegex);
			In order, the four match calls would return the values ["big"], ["bag"], ["bug"], and null.*/
