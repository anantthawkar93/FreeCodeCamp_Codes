					<!-- Handle a Fulfilled Promise with then
		Promises are most useful when you have a process that takes an unknown amount of time in your code (i.e. something asynchronous), often a server request. When you make a server request it takes some amount of time, and after it completes you usually want to do something with the response from the server. This can be achieved by using the then method. The then method is executed immediately after your promise is fulfilled with resolve. Hereâ€™s an example:

		myPromise.then(result => {
		  
		});
		result comes from the argument given to the resolve method. -->
