		/*Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator
		Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

		If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

		Examples

		3 ===  3
		3 === '3'
		These conditions would return true and false respectively.
