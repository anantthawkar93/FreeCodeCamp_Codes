		/*Comparison with the Equality Operator
		There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.

		The most basic operator is the equality operator ==.
		In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as Type Coercion. Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:
		1   ==  1
		1   ==  2
		1   == '1'
		"3" ==  3
		In order, these expressions would evaluate to true, false, true, and true.
